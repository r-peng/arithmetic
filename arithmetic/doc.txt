what do the functions do: 
build.py: 
- tn for polynomial (q11(x1)+...q1N(xN))*...*(qk1(x1)+...qkN(xN))
compress.py: 
- polynomial tn to peps
- contract general peps
quartic.py:
- pol(xAx) with optional quartic terms
nn_mps.py,nn_mpo.py,nn_peps.py:
-feed-forward nn
nn_pepo.py: 
- unfinished

future directions: 
1. feed-forward nn: constructing (reusable) MPS by 3D contraction
2. RAC integration
3. structured contraction with reusable intermediates for e.g. CAC
